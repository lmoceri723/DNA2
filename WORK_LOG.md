| Oct 10 | 11:25-11:55am | I used the whiteboard in class to draft an initial approach to the problem. My idea is a method similar to binary search in which I look at chars in the middle of a section and find sequences of repeats. I then repeat the same process for the new largest unsearched chunk and I keep doing so until the largest STR repeat size exceeds the maximum unsearched chunk's size. THis allows me to exit checking early, giving my algorithm huge gains. I started implementing this method but did not finish in class. |

I talked at the board with my friends and came up with a more efficient solution to the problem by compressing the chars into bits to go to o(1) comparisons. I started working on this new solution and am about 1/3 done. |
