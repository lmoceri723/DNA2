| Oct 10 |  11:25-11:55am  | I used the whiteboard in class to draft an initial approach to the problem. My idea is a method similar to binary search in which I look at chars in the middle of a section and find sequences of repeats. I then repeat the same process for the new largest unsearched chunk and I keep doing so until the largest STR repeat size exceeds the maximum unsearched chunk's size. This allows me to exit checking early, giving my algorithm huge gains. I started implementing this method but did not finish in class. |

I talked at the board with my friends and came up with a more efficient solution to the problem by compressing the chars into bits to go to o(1) comparisons. I started working on this new solution and am about 1/3 done. |

I left shift away the first base, convert the last base to a number, and transform my buffer to match the next part that needs to be checked. My code passes all test cases except for test larger, but im unsure if its an error with the test case or my code. |

I found one bug in my code and fixed it by adding an extra out of bounds check. I currently pass all test cases in 1.6s. |
| Oct 21 |  11:20-11:50am  |                                                                                                                                                              I reviewed the slides and implemented Horner's method. I then started writing the code for Rabin-Karp Algorithm. I didn't finish, but I made good headway and have good plans in my head. I estimate this solution will be slower, so I'd like to try and implement some bitwise operations to try and speed it up. (I forgot to commit at the end of class) |

I realized about 5 minutes ago that my for loop was fundamentally wrong, so I erased my loop and started rewriting. I currently over-return values. I will fix this for loop with the logic from the slides and hopefully it will work this time. |

I need to revisit this some other time. I am making progress, and I likely have some small bug I'm just blind to right now. |
| Oct 23 | 11:35pm-12:00am |                                   I decided just to start from scratch, and I decided to just go directly for the most optimized version of the program. I used the two bit codes, which simplified the radix down to 4. It also eliminates the need for modding by p, as the largest hash becomes 20 bits. It made bit operations very easy to think about, so I used bitwise or and left shift instead of multiplication and addition. I got both functions working (rabinKarp and hornerHash) and pass all test cases. |

In the case we're given, the bit operations give the same result and are faster. I still pass all tests cases in good time. |
